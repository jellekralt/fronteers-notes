> The goal of Web design is not merely to dazlle, but to deliver information to the widest audience

1. Basic content and functionality should be accessible to all web browsers
2. Sparse, semantic markup should cover
    * Content should be defined in plain text in the markup
3. Enhanced layout can be provided by CSS stylesheets
4. Enhanced behaviour can be provided by unobtrusive JavaScript
5. End-user web browser preferences should be respected

## What can go wrong
* JavaScirpt is not enabled in the browser
* The browser does not support a particular feature

## CSS Progressive Enhancement
1. Start with sensible HTML
2. Take advantage of the cascade
3. Go 'mobile-first'
4. Use flexbox


* As a last resort, use seperate stylesheets
